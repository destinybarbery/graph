	<h1>Plants</h1>
	<p>You walk down the street and see all the pretty flowers and trees. But they are so much more than just pretty, they are working hard for us day in and day out. Plants provide us with oxygen which as you all know is what we humans need to survive. In turn we provide them with carbon dioxide which helps them grow. So yes it is a very loving relationship but as of late we humans have been cutting down a lot of trees, killing a lot of plants and stripping other animals of their home/food sources all to build the skyscrapers and apartments we see daily. By doing this we are basically constantly cutting down our oxygen supply, sounds bad when we put it like that right? Well it is the truth, the more we cut down and kill our beautiful plants the less they are able to make and supply us with oxygen. Also as mentioned before we are not the only ones relying on these plants, other animals are. So we are killing them just as fast as we are killing ourselves. So what can you do? You can start your own garden help make up for the plants these big corporations are constantly stripping from the ground. And if it is hard just start with one plant. If you even plant one flower thats one more flower that wasnâ€™t there.</p>
