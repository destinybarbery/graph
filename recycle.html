	<h1>RECYCLE PLEASE</h1>
	<p>In a world where everything is meant to be sent at the speed of light, we face the issue of the earth becoming congested with garbage. There is so much packaging that our items come with. Think about how often you order from amazon and all the plastic and cardboard that is used to deliver your tiny or not so tiny item. Now that you have that in mind imagine how many other people are like you ordering just as much if not more. When we dont recycle all of the resources that we couldve reused get stuck in landfills instead of coming back as something new. There are 7 billion people in the world so our landfills are getting filled very quickly. We can reduce the amount that goes to them by takoing any paper glass or plastic items we have and putting them in the appropriate bins/pales. If everyone in the world were to do this our landfills would see a dramatic change and we would actually save money as a nation because we would be able to use resources we already have instead of having to go source externally or constantly make new ones. Also its very easy, for instance glass can simply be melted down and reshaped and a repurposed, its so easy and simple why wouldnt you want to do it. When you were younger you learned reduce reuse recycle, recycling allows you to reduce and reuse. Will you take the first step to taking care of this world, your world, our world?</p>
